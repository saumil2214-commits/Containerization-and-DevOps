#  Experiment 1: VM vs Containers using Ubuntu & Nginx 

## Dated : 
> 24th Jan 2026, due to some error on MAC OS. I have performed this experiment on my friends laptop and took photos for the experiment snd uploaded it here in the readme file.
Therefore, the experiment is performed by me but on her Laptop 

##  Objective
The objective of this experiment is to understand, implement, and compare:
- Virtual Machines using VirtualBox and Vagrant
- Containers using Docker
by deploying an Nginx web server in both environments and observing resource utilization.

---

##  System Requirements
### Hardware
- 64-bit system with virtualization enabled
- Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- Internet connection

### Software
- Windows OS
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Ubuntu (Vagrant box)
- Docker Engine

---

##  Part A: Virtual Machine Setup using Vagrant

###  Step 1: Verify Vagrant Installation
```
vagrant --version
```

###  Step 2: Create Project Directory
```
mkdir vm-lab
cd vm-lab
```

###  Step 3: Initialize Vagrant with Ubuntu Box
```
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64
```

###  Step 4: Start the Virtual Machine
```
vagrant up
```

###  Step 5: Access the VM via SSH
```
vagrant ssh
```

---

##  Install Nginx inside VM
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

###  Verify Nginx
```
curl localhost
```

---

##  Resource Observation (VM)
```
free -h
htop
systemd-analyze
```

---

##  Part B: Container Setup using Docker (inside VM)

###  Step 1: Install Docker
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker vagrant
```

Re-login to apply permissions:
```
exit
vagrant ssh
```

###  Verify Docker
```
docker --version
```

---

##  Run Nginx Container
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-container nginx
```

###  Verify Nginx Container
```
curl localhost:8080
```

---

##  Resource Observation (Container)
```
docker stats
free -h
```

---

##  Cleanup Commands
```
docker stop nginx-container
docker rm nginx-container
exit
vagrant halt


##  Comparison Summary

| Parameter | Virtual Machine | Container |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Boot Time | High | Very Low |
| RAM Usage | High | Low |
| CPU Overhead | Higher | Minimal |
| Disk Usage | Larger | Smaller |
| Isolation | Strong | Moderate |



## Results
This experiment demonstrates that containers are significantly more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines. While virtual machines provide stronger isolation and a complete OS-level abstraction, containers are faster, more scalable, and better suited for modern DevOps workflows.

---

## Conclusion
Virtual Machines and Containers both have their place in modern infrastructure. However, containers are preferred in cloud-native and DevOps environments due to their speed, efficiency, and portability.
