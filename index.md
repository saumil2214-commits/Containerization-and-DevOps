## Experiment 9 - Ansible Automation with Docker

- Set up SSH key-based authentication between a control machine and multiple remote servers, and understand why this is essential for automated, passwordless server management.
- Use Ansible modules such as apt, copy, command, and debug to perform common system administration tasks declaratively.
- Demonstrate idempotency — understanding that running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result without unintended side effects, which is a critical property for reliable infrastructure automation.
- Execute ad-hoc Ansible commands for quick, one-off tasks without writing a full playbook.
- Use Docker containers as simulated servers to practice multi-node infrastructure management in a local environment without requiring real cloud VMs.
- Recognize the practical value of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — how version-controlled, declarative configuration files eliminate configuration drift and enable consistent, repeatable deployments at scale.

## Experiment 10 - SonarQube: Continuous Code Quality Inspection
All objectives of Experiment 10 were successfully completed.
The experiment demonstrated a practical understanding of:
Here are 5 practical understanding points for Lab 10:
- SonarQube needs two separate components to work You can't just run the server — nothing gets analyzed. And you can't just run the scanner — there's nowhere to send results. You learned this hands-on when you ran docker compose up -d for the server first, then separately triggered mvn sonar:sonar as the scanner. Both must be running and connected for the pipeline to work.
- Static analysis finds bugs without executing the code Maven never actually ran your Calculator.java — it just read it. Yet SonarQube still caught the divide-by-zero risk and the SQL injection vulnerability. This is what "static analysis" means in practice — the tool reads your code the way a senior developer would during a code review, spotting patterns that are known to cause problems.
- The Quality Gate is what connects code quality to deployment The Jenkinsfile you wrote has waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true — meaning if your code fails the gate, the pipeline stops and nothing gets deployed. This is the practical enforcement mechanism. Without it, SonarQube is just a report nobody reads. With it, bad code physically cannot reach production.
- Technical debt is measurable, not just a feeling Before this lab, "bad code" was vague. SonarQube put a number on it — approximately 2 hours of estimated fix time. This is how real engineering teams justify refactoring work to managers: not "the code feels messy" but "we have 14 hours of technical debt accumulating at 2 hours per sprint."
- The fix-and-rescan cycle is the actual workflow When you fixed the divide-by-zero bug and re-ran mvn sonar:sonar, the bug count dropped on the dashboard immediately. This is exactly how developers use SonarQube in real jobs — write code, push it, scanner runs in CI, you get a report, you fix issues, you push again, the gate turns green. The tool only has value if you close the loop, which you demonstrated by doing the rescan.

## Experiment 11 — Docker Orchestration
This experiment successfully demonstrated the transition from basic multi-container management using **Docker Compose** to production-grade **container orchestration using Docker Swarm**.
 
The core limitations of Docker Compose — manual scaling, no fault tolerance, and single-host restriction — were directly addressed by Swarm's orchestration layer. By deploying the same `docker-compose.yml` file as a Swarm stack, we achieved:
 
- **Automatic scaling** with a single command, managed by an internal load balancer
- **Self-healing** that required zero operator intervention when a container failed
- **Rolling updates** that kept the application live during image refreshes
- **Overlay networking** that enabled secure service-to-service communication across potential multi-node clusters
The experiment also highlighted the practical trade-offs in the orchestration spectrum. Docker Compose remains the ideal tool for local development due to its simplicity, while Docker Swarm bridges the gap toward production with manageable complexity. For large-scale deployments requiring advanced features like auto-scaling, fine-grained resource management, and cross-cloud federation, **Kubernetes** remains the industry standard next step.
 
In summary, Docker Swarm demonstrated that orchestration is not just about running containers — it is about maintaining a **desired state** reliably, automatically, and at scale, regardless of individual container failures.

## Experiment 12 — Container Orchestration using Kubernetes
This experiment gave a real-world, end-to-end understanding of Kubernetes far beyond theory.

Starting from basic concepts, I deployed WordPress using proper YAML manifests, exposed it through a Service, scaled it horizontally, and demonstrated self-healing. The Apache practical covered the full application lifecycle — from raw pod to managed deployment with debugging and live content modification.

Part D elevated the experiment to a production-style setup: three Ubuntu VMs joined into a real kubeadm cluster with a proper control plane, Calico networking, and worker nodes — the same architecture used in real companies.

The bonus operations — rolling updates, rollbacks, metrics, namespaces, ConfigMaps, and YAML exports — show production-readiness beyond what the lab sheet required.

**Biggest takeaways:**
- Kubernetes is not just a container runner — it is a full platform for managing application lifecycle
- Self-healing, scaling, and rollbacks make it genuinely production-grade
- The gap between theory and hands-on understanding is enormous — this lab closed that gap

### Class Practical — 1 Apr (Jenkins on Docker)
This class practical successfully demonstrates the deployment of Jenkins inside a Docker container on Apple Silicon hardware. By leveraging Docker's multi-platform support and Docker Compose for service orchestration, a production-ready Jenkins CI/CD server was configured with minimal infrastructure overhead.

- Docker images may not natively support ARM architecture; the `platform` flag enables emulation
- Port conflicts are common in local development setups and can be resolved by remapping host ports
- Named volumes ensure Jenkins data persistence across container lifecycles
- Jenkins initial setup is straightforward, but debugging container and networking issues requires familiarity with Docker fundamentals

### Class Practical — 10 Apr Task (Dockerize a Python FastAPI server, automate build & push to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions)
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a DevOps practice where code changes are:
- Automatically built
- Automatically tested
- Automatically prepared for release

I now have validated a complete pipeline:

- Code Change → Git Push → GitHub Actions → Docker Build → Docker Push → Local Run → Verified Output
